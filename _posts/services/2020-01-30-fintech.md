Conventional wisdom suggests that good friendships enhance an individual's sense of happiness and overall well-being. Indeed, a number of studies have found that strong social supports improve a woman's prospects for good health and longevity.

Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral vaccine" that boosts both physical and mental health.

## Develop

Frisco was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

## Editing

Frisco is already optimised for adding, updating and removing pages, staff, advice, company details and footer elements in CloudCannon.

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The **Staff Author** field links to members in the **Staff Members** collection.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with CloudCannon, but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).

### Staff

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.
